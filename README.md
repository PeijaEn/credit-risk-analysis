### Overview of the Loan Prediction Risk Analysis



### Results



### Summary

The Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier had the highest overall accuracy out of all my models. This may have been due to the data being so unbalance, you can see this within its F-score for high risk prediciton being 0.16 only, nowhere near .9. I would not advise these models to be used in actual analysis but if I was forced to choose one it would be the Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier.
